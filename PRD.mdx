**Anoda Facematch**

### Overview

The essence of ths application is to have someone be able to have users sign up upload pictures with albums and the feature I mostly care about is the facematching.
So what would happen is when a picture is opened up we can then select the faces it recognize to search for other pictures with that face in that album.
That is the high level overview

### UI Design

- **Primary Icon:** Headphone icon
- **Battery Percentage:** Centered text below the icon
- **Charging Indicator:** Lightning emoji (⚡) next to the percentage if charging

### Data Source

I am using PostgreSQL for storing reference to the images and in development I store the images locally, and in production in either AWS or cloudinary

### Plugin Functionality

- **Polling Interval:** Default 30 seconds (configurable via settings)
- **Battery Fetching Method:** Reverse-engineered using USB HID or existing Windows APIs
- **Stream Deck Integration:**
  - Uses the [Stream Deck SDK](https://docs.elgato.com/streamdeck/sdk/introduction/getting-started)
  - Follows the [Key Plugin Guide](https://docs.elgato.com/streamdeck/sdk/guides/keys)
