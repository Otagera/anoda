# Anoda Facematch

### Overview

This application, Anoda Facematch, allows users to upload photos and organize them into albums. The primary feature is face-matching. When viewing a photo, a user can select a recognized face and search for other photos within the same album containing that face.  Users will also be able to share their albums by generating a link that will allow others to view the album's photos and perform face searches.

For this demo application, a simplified authentication will be used. This allows users to quickly start uploading pictures and using the app. Only the uploader and those they share album links with will be able to view the content.

The application uses a Python script to analyze uploaded images and store data about the faces it recognizes. In the future, this image processing will be moved to a background worker for better performance.

This is a high-level overview of the application.

### Scalability Considerations

As this application grows, it will be important to address the following scalability concerns:

*   **Database:** The PostgreSQL database will need to efficiently handle an increasing number of photos and recognized faces. Database query optimization and potential schema adjustments may be needed.
*   **Image Processing:** The Python image processing script (or the future background worker) will need to scale to handle many image uploads concurrently. We will need to make sure that it has enough resources.
*   **Face Matching:** The face-matching algorithm may need to be optimized to maintain fast search times as the number of stored faces increases.
*   **Storage:** The storage solution (local in development, Cloudinary/AWS in production) must be able to accommodate a growing volume of image data.
* **Authentication**: The authentication will need to handle an increasing number of users.

These are initial considerations and will be revisited as development progresses.

### UI Design

The application will have a clean and modern design, similar to the UI found on [playbook.com](https://playbook.com). The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate.  Tailwind CSS will be used as the primary styling framework, leveraging its utility classes to create a consistent visual style.

The UI will consist of the following key components:

-   **Welcome Page:** The initial page users see when opening the application.
-   **Albums Page:** This page will display all of the user's albums and provide a way to create new ones.
-   **Album Page:** Displays all the photos within a selected album.
-   **Image Modal:** A modal that appears when a user clicks on a photo in an album. It will display more information about the photo and show the faces that have been recognized in the image.
- **Search Page:** After a face is clicked on in the Image Modal a search will be initiated and the result will be displayed in the Search page.

The following framework will be used:

-   React
-   React Router DOM
-   TypeScript
-   Tailwind CSS
-   `tanstack/react-query`

The color schemes and fonts will be based on what tailwind provides, and will be revisited at a later date.

### Data Source

PostgreSQL will be used as the database for the application. The database will store paths that reference the images. In development, the images will be stored locally on the filesystem, while in production, images will be stored in either AWS S3 or Cloudinary.

The `pg` library will be used for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, and raw SQL queries will be used. ORMs may be revisited in the future if raw queries become too difficult to manage.

Redis will be used as a caching layer to improve query performance.

CREATE TABLE images ( image_id UUID PRIMARY KEY, image_path TEXT NOT NULL, upload_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, original_size JSON );

CREATE TABLE faces ( face_id UUID PRIMARY KEY, image_id UUID REFERENCES images(image_id), embedding _FLOAT4, bounding_box JSONB, processed_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

CREATE TABLE albums ( album_id UUID PRIMARY KEY, album_name TEXT, created_by UUID REFERENCES users(user_id), creation_date TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, shared_link TEXT );

CREATE TABLE album_images ( image_id UUID REFERENCES images(image_id), album_id UUID REFERENCES albums(album_id) );

CREATE TABLE users ( user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY );


### Implementation Details

-   **Tech Stack:**
    -   Server: JavaScript (Node.js, Express.js)
    -   Client: TypeScript, ReactJS, React Router DOM, Tailwind CSS
- **Python**:
    - Python will be used for the face recognition script.
-   **Configuration:**
    -   Docker will be used to deploy the application. There will be two main containers: one for the server application (Node.js with Express.js) and one for the client application (React). Both containers will be initialized when the docker application is deployed. The python application will be available in the server container, so the face recognition script can be used.
